MENTAL AWARENESS :

Our team “Panthers” have successfully came up with a hack for one of the given themes “Mental Health and Awareness” with an idea and implementation of a website. We have developed a website for the people who have been enduring any sort of self-abasement that led to some severe mental stress. People are sliping to a state of mental depression and anxiety and this has been increased in this pandemic and being students we are also facing the same so we have came up with this idea to resolve this. 

The website contains all the best methods to escape a poor mental state with a stimulating output.

Starting from the deep astounding logo to the intensive lines of quotes we have set that at the beginning of every page. The following elements are -
 we have put a playlist(scrollable) with some soothing music keeping the volume control.
“Food is a mood” so suggesting the best Healthy food with some relatable photographs is coming next. Besides, we have linked a website to dig into it.
“Books are the best mates”.. So we have kept a book suggestion list for the people to heal their pain with a website link where they can get all the relevant books pdf free.
Exercise is the ultimate solution to keep a dizzy mind calm ..with the best exercise gesture photographs and a yoga video link would make their mental health normal.
We have kept all the necessary steps to analyze what exactly he/she is going through when they face all the difficulties and could not find a way out ..so the steps to be taken to get one’s problem and taking the action is the key to get recovered.
More courage with more success stories ...we have put the testimonial part with others experiences
The most significant part of the website is that the patient can book an appointment for a doctor consultation on their own choice for the treatment ..and the details we have put inside the contact page.
In the about page we have put a short description about us with our photographs.
In the blog page we have put some good content on mental awareness which can deeply change the persistent and poor mental state to a positive one.

Technologies used: To turn our idea into reality we have used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap Javascipt and PHP.
